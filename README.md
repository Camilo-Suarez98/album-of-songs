## My process

### Built with

- React + Vite
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about State Hook to select if a song like it or not clicking on a heart

```js
const [ like, setLike ] = useState(false)
```

### Useful resources

- [Official React Doc](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) - This helped me to understand a little more about state hook
